title: Trust in the Lord
---

## Proverbs 3:5-6

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

In our daily lives, we often face decisions and challenges that seem overwhelming. This passage reminds us that true wisdom comes from trusting God completely, rather than relying solely on our own limited perspective.

When we acknowledge God in all our ways—in our relationships, our work, our struggles, and our victories—He promises to direct our paths. This doesn't mean life will be without difficulties, but it means we won't walk through them alone.

### Reflection

- Are there areas in your life where you're relying more on your own understanding than on God's guidance?
- How can you practically "acknowledge Him" in your daily decisions today?

**Prayer**: Lord, help me to trust You with my whole heart. Guide my steps today and give me the wisdom to seek Your direction in all things. Amen.
