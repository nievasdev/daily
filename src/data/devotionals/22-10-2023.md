title: God's Unfailing Love
---

## Psalm 136:1

> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.

In a world where everything seems temporary and fleeting, we can anchor ourselves in the unchanging truth that God's love endures forever. His love isn't dependent on our performance, our circumstances, or our feelings.

The psalmist repeats "His love endures forever" throughout Psalm 136, emphasizing that no matter what happens—through creation, through exodus, through exile, through every season of life—God's love remains constant.

### Today's Reminder

Whatever you're facing today, remember:
- God's love for you hasn't changed
- His love won't change tomorrow
- His love is not conditional

**Prayer**: Thank You, Lord, for Your enduring love. Help me to rest in the security of Your unchanging character. Let Your love overflow through me to others today. Amen.
