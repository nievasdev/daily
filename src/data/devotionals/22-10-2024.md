title: The Power of Faith
---

## Matthew 17:20

> He replied, "Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

Faith isn't about the size of our belief, but about the size of our God. Even the smallest genuine faith in an infinite God can move mountains in our lives.

Today, reflect on the obstacles in your life. What "mountains" seem immovable? God is calling you to trust Him, not in your ability to have great faith, but in His ability to do great things.

### Application

- Identify one "mountain" in your life that needs moving
- Bring it to God in prayer with genuine faith
- Trust that He is working, even when you can't see it

**Prayer**: Heavenly Father, increase my faith. Help me to trust that with You, nothing is impossible. Move the mountains in my life according to Your perfect will. Amen.
